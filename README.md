## 📌 Project Overview

**DevTrack** is a web platform that connects to a developer's GitHub profile and converts their public activity — repositories, commits, languages, stars, forks, pull requests — into structured, actionable intelligence.

Instead of just listing repositories like a typical GitHub stats widget, DevTrack computes a quantitative **Developer Score**, runs that score through a **rules-based AI insight engine** to surface strengths, weaknesses, and a personalized learning roadmap, and packages a year of activity into a **GitHub Wrapped**–style summary.

The product is built to support three audiences at once:

| Audience | What DevTrack gives them |
|---|---|
| **Developers** | An objective, explainable score and a roadmap for what to improve next |
| **Recruiters / Reviewers** | A fast, visual read on a candidate's technical breadth and consistency |
| **Researchers / Admissions reviewers** | Quantified evidence of growth, diversity, and open-source contribution for academic portfolios |

A live demo mode (`?user=demo`) is built in, so anyone can explore the full dashboard — Developer Score, AI Insights, and Wrapped — without connecting a GitHub account or configuring Firebase.

### 🌐 Live Demo

**[https://dev-track-brown.vercel.app/](https://dev-track-brown.vercel.app/)**

Click **"Try Demo"** on the landing page (or visit `/dashboard?user=demo` directly) to explore the full dashboard instantly — no sign-in required.

---

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

> **Vision:** Become the developer-facing equivalent of a credit score — a single, explainable number and narrative that represents technical growth, consistency, and open-source impact.

**Mission:**

- Turn passive GitHub activity into **active self-awareness** for developers.
- Replace vanity metrics (raw star counts) with a **multi-factor, explainable score**.
- Give every developer a **personalized roadmap**, not just a dashboard.
- Provide a **research-grade analytics layer** that's credible enough to support graduate-school and job applications.

DevTrack is intentionally positioned as a **Developer Intelligence Platform**, not "another GitHub stats card."

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

DevTrack follows a layered architecture: a Next.js App Router frontend calls a thin service layer, which calls external providers (GitHub REST API, Firebase) and feeds the result through two in-house intelligence services before rendering.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Browser — Next.js App Router\n(page.tsx / dashboard/page.tsx)"] --> B["UI Components\nNavbar · AuthModal · DashboardContent · Tabs"]
    B --> C["lib/firebase.ts\nAuth + Firestore client"]
    B --> D["lib/github.ts\nfetchGitHubDashboardData()"]
    C --> E["Firebase Authentication\n(GitHub OAuth provider)"]
    C --> F["Cloud Firestore\ndeveloper_profiles collection"]
    D --> G["GitHub REST API v3\n/users, /repos, /events"]
    D --> H["services/score.ts\ncalculateDeveloperScore()"]
    D --> I["services/ai.ts\ngenerateAIInsights()"]
    H --> I
    H --> B
    I --> B
```

**Design principles:**

- **Service isolation** — `lib/github.ts` knows nothing about React; `services/score.ts` and `services/ai.ts` are pure functions that take typed data in and return typed data out.
- **Graceful degradation** — every external dependency (Firebase, GitHub token, live event data) has a deterministic fallback so the app never shows a broken state.
- **Typed contracts** — every cross-layer object (`GitHubProfile`, `DeveloperScore`, `AIInsights`, `UserDashboardData`, …) is defined once in `src/types/index.ts` and shared across the entire stack.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

DevTrack uses **Firebase Authentication** with the **GitHub provider**, with a built-in mock mode so the app is fully functional before any credentials are configured.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant M as AuthModal
    participant F as Firebase Auth
    participant G as GitHub OAuth
    participant L as localStorage

    U->>M: Click "Sign in with GitHub"
    M->>F: signInWithPopup(GithubAuthProvider)
    F->>G: Redirect to GitHub authorization
    G-->>F: Authorization code + access token
    F-->>M: User credential + GitHub access token
    M->>L: Persist DevTrackUser session
    M-->>U: Redirect to /dashboard?user={githubUsername}
```

**Key behaviors:**

- OAuth scopes requested: `read:user`, `repo`
- On every sign-in, the returned **GitHub access token** is attached to the session so subsequent API calls aren't subject to the unauthenticated GitHub rate limit (60 req/hr).
- `subscribeToAuthChanges()` listens for Firebase auth state changes and rehydrates the session on page reload.
- **If Firebase environment variables are absent**, the app automatically falls back to a **mock authentication mode** — a demo user (`devtrack-demo`) is created in `localStorage` so the product remains demoable in any environment, including local development without secrets.

**Production hardening still needed (see [Roadmap](#-future-roadmap)):** structured error handling for popup-blocked/cancelled flows, first-time-user onboarding, and refresh-token handling for expired GitHub tokens.

---

## 🔗 GitHub Integration Flow

All analytics are derived from a single orchestration function, `fetchGitHubDashboardData(username, token)`, in `src/lib/github.ts`:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Username input] --> B{username is\n'demo'?}
    B -- Yes --> C[getDemoDashboardData\nCurated sample dataset]
    B -- No --> D["/users/{username}"]
    D --> E["/users/{username}/repos"]
    E --> F["/users/{username}/events"]
    F --> G[parseContributions\ncommits · PRs · issues · streaks]
    F --> H[aggregateLanguages\nsize-weighted language %]
    G --> I[calculateDeveloperScore]
    H --> I
    I --> J[generateAIInsights]
    G --> K[generateWrappedData]
    I --> L[UserDashboardData]
    J --> L
    K --> L
    L --> M[Rendered Dashboard]
```

**Notable engineering decisions:**

- **Event-based streak calculation** — `parseContributions` walks the last 100 GitHub events to compute daily activity, longest streak, and current streak.
- **Heuristic fallback for sparse data** — because the GitHub Events API only returns recent activity, commit/PR/issue totals are floored with a conservative estimate derived from `public_repos`, `stargazers_count`, and `forks_count`, so scores never bottom out purely due to API pagination limits.
- **Size-weighted language stats** — `aggregateLanguages` approximates language share using each repository's `size` (KB) as a proxy, sorted by weight descending.
- **Instant demo path** — `username === "demo"` or `"devtrack-demo"` short-circuits straight to a hand-curated dataset, bypassing the GitHub API entirely.

---

## 🧮 Developer Score System

The **Developer Score** is a deterministic, fully explainable 0–100 metric computed in `services/score.ts`. It is the core differentiator of the product — every sub-score ships with a plain-English justification string.

```
Developer Score (0–100)
   =  Consistency      (0–20)
   +  Repository Quality (0–20)
   +  Technical Diversity (0–20)
   +  Open Source Impact (0–20)
   +  Project Complexity (0–20)
```

| Category | Max | Formula (simplified) | Signal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Consistency** | 20 | `min(10, totalCommits/200 × 10)` + `min(10, longestStreak/21 × 10)` | Commit volume + streak length |
| **Repository Quality** | 20 | `min(10, log₂(avgStars+1) × 3)` + `(reposWithDescription / totalRepos) × 10` | Community validation + documentation discipline |
| **Technical Diversity** | 20 | `min(10, uniqueLanguages/5 × 10)` + entropy-based balance score | Breadth + how evenly spread across stacks |
| **Open Source Impact** | 20 | `min(10, log₂(totalForks+1) × 3.3)` + `min(10, (PRs+Issues)/25 × 10)` | External reuse + collaboration activity |
| **Project Complexity** | 20 | `min(10, avgRepoSizeKB/50000 × 10)` + `(originalRepos / totalRepos) × 10` | Codebase substance + originality vs. forks |

Each category returns a `*Reason` string (e.g. *"High commit regularity and solid continuous contribution streak"*) so the score is never a black box — this is the foundation the AI Insights Engine builds on top of.

---

## 🤖 AI Intelligence Engine

The **AI Insights Engine** (`services/ai.ts`) is a **deterministic rules engine**, not a third-party LLM call — it converts the five Developer Score categories into structured, narrative guidance with zero network latency and zero token cost.

**Current outputs:**

| Output | How it's derived |
|---|---|
| **Strengths** | Triggered when a category clears a high threshold (e.g. `diversity ≥ 15` → "Polyglot profile with capability in multiple ecosystems") |
| **Weaknesses** | Triggered when a category falls below a low threshold, with safe fallbacks so the list is never empty or hostile |
| **Recommendations** | Category-specific action items (e.g. low `repoQuality` → "Write rich README files for your top 3 pinned repos") |
| **Suggested Technologies** | Mapped from the developer's dominant language (TypeScript → Next.js/GraphQL/Prisma; Python → FastAPI/PyTorch/LangChain; Go → gRPC/Kafka/Kubernetes; Rust → Tokio/WASM/Tauri) |
| **Career Direction** | Combines top language + overall score band (e.g. TypeScript + score > 75 → *"Senior Full-Stack Web Engineer / Architect"*) |
| **Learning Roadmap** | A fixed 3-stage plan — *Foundational Strengthening → Architecture & Integration → DevOps & Open Source Scaling* — populated with the developer's own suggested stack |

**Why rules-based first?** It guarantees the engine is fast, free to run, fully reproducible, and safe to ship without prompt-injection or hallucination risk — while still satisfying the product's "AI-powered" positioning honestly.

**Planned upgrade (Phase 5):** swap the static thresholds for an LLM-backed generation layer (e.g. via the Anthropic API) that takes the same `DeveloperScore` + GitHub dataset as structured input and produces richer, more personalized natural-language narratives, interview-prep suggestions, and project ideas — without changing the existing type contracts.

---

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** ≥ 18.18
- **npm**, **yarn**, **pnpm**, or **bun**
- A **GitHub account** (for OAuth setup — optional, demo mode works without it)
- A **Firebase project** (optional — only required for real authentication and persistence)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/arupdas0825/Dev-Track.git
cd Dev-Track

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment variables (optional — see below)
cp .env.example .env.local   # create this file if it doesn't exist yet

# 4. Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If no Firebase credentials are configured, DevTrack automatically runs in **mock auth mode** — click **"Try Demo"** or sign in to explore the full dashboard with sample data.

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

All variables are **optional** — DevTrack falls back to demo/mock mode when they're missing. They are required only for real Firebase-backed GitHub OAuth and Firestore persistence.

| Variable | Required for | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Auth + Firestore | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Auth | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Auth + Firestore | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Firestore | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Auth | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` | Auth + Firestore | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Analytics | Firebase Console → Project Settings → General |

Example `.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=000000000000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:000000000000:web:xxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

> ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` — it is already covered by `.gitignore`.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2. Navigate to **Build → Authentication → Sign-in method** and enable the **GitHub** provider.
3. Navigate to **Build → Firestore Database** and create a database (start in test mode for local development, then lock down rules before production).
4. Go to **Project Settings → General → Your apps**, register a **Web app**, and copy the config values into `.env.local` as shown above.
5. Under **Authentication → Settings**, copy the **authorized redirect URI** — you'll need it for the GitHub OAuth App in the next step.

---

## 🐙 GitHub OAuth Setup

1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → OAuth Apps → New OAuth App**.
2. Fill in:
   - **Application name:** `DevTrack`
   - **Homepage URL:** `https://dev-track-brown.vercel.app/`
   - **Authorization callback URL:** `https://<your-firebase-project-id>.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
3. Click **Register application**, then generate a **Client Secret**.
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the GitHub provider configuration in **Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method → GitHub**.
5. Save — GitHub sign-in via `signInWithPopup` will now issue real access tokens through Firebase.

---

## 💻 Running Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The dev server supports Fast Refresh — most component edits apply instantly.

---

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

`npm run build` produces an optimized production build; `npm run start` serves it. Run `npm run lint` before committing to catch ESLint issues early.

---

## 🚀 Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your fork/clone to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) and import the repository.
3. Vercel auto-detects the Next.js framework — no build command overrides needed.
4. Add all variables from [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) under **Project Settings → Environment Variables**.
5. Click **Deploy**.
6. Update your GitHub OAuth App's **Authorization callback URL** and Firebase **Authorized domains** to include your new Vercel domain.

---
